This is a repo for my SER2024 Presentation on per protocol analysis using ACTG 5202 as an example.

Included is a PDF of the presetation I gave in a session on per-protocol analyses of RCTs with Catherine Li (UNC), Sarah Robertson (Harvard), Trang Nguyen (JHU), and Ellen Caniglia (UPenn).

Please reach out with any questions.
