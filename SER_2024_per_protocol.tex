\section{RCTs}
    \begin{frame}{Randomized Trials are a gold standard}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Require clear enrollment criteria.
            \item Unabmiguous intervention protocol.
            \item Exchangeability: $Y^a \upmodels A $ \hspace{0.5cm}for $A \in \{0,1\}$  
            \item Consistency: $Y=Y^{a=1}A+Y^{a=0}(1-A)$
            \item Positivity\footnotemark[1]: $Pr(A=a)>0$
            \item[\ding{43}] This allows for unbiased estimation of treatment effects.
        \end{itemize} 
        \note{\begin{itemize}
        \item RCTs are classically considered the gold standard in evaluating treatment effects. The status of RCTs originates from aspects of the design that help assure causal estimates are identified
        \item Some of these included clear enumeration of the population unders study, clearly laid out treatment protocols, and other causal identification criteria of marginal exchangeability, causal consistency and positivity being met by design.
    \end{itemize}} 
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}{RCT estimands}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Intention-to-treat (ITT) effect: $E[Y^{r=1}]-E[Y^{r=0}]$
            \item This is the effect of treatment assignment on outcomes
            \item Public health focused
            \vspace{1cm}
            \item \textit{Typical} Per-protocol (PP) effect: $E[Y^{r=1, \bar{a}=1}]-E[Y^{r=0, \bar{a}=0}]$
            \item This is the effect of treatment assignment and adherence on outcomes
            \item Patient focused\footnotemark[1]
        \end{itemize}
        \blfootnote{$R =$ randomization; $\bar{a}=$ history of treatment} 
        \footnotetext[1]{Hernan and Robins, NEJM 2016}
        \note{
        \begin{itemize}
        \item There are two commonly reported estimands in an RCT. The primary result reported is typically the intention-to-treat results which present the outcomes had everyone been assigned to treatment 1 versus everyone being assigned to treatment 0. 
        \item However, while this is public health focused, it is limited to evaluating the effect of randomization and not the effect of treatment.
        \item Instead, decision makers (e.g. physician) and those on the receiving end of the treatment may want to know instead waht is the effect if adherent to the treatment assignment. This cannot be answered with the ITT estimand and instead requires a per-protocol analysis that takes into account deviation or loss to follow up.

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Per protocol effects are typically estimated by excluding those that deviate from the protocol
            \item However, these estimates should be thought of more like analyzing an observational study where common causes of the outcome of interest and adherence should be accounted for--this has been well reported since 2001 by Robins and Finkelstein
            \item As a result of this per protocol estimates can be biased.
            \item Here is a simple DAG illustrating the problem. If per protocol analyses are done where only those who adhere are included you create a selection bias. 
            \item Here this is by conditioning on a selection which is downstream of a collider, treatment adherence.
            \item However instead of restricting to only those that adhere there are ways around this which will be covered by the other speakers.

Adherence evaluated in-person at 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, then every 24 weeks and either at the final study evaluation or after virologic failure.

\end{table}
\note{Adhrence in ACTG 5202 was collecetd by self report and whether or not there were missed doses within a previous time frame. There was also information about how closesly a dosing regimen was followed but we did not incorporate that here.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
We defined protocol deviation, illustrated in the bottom table,  by how many missed doses were acceptable. For instance if 0 doses missed were OK, then as soon as a person reported missing any doses they were censored. For those where missing 4 doses was ok, as soon as they missed the fifth dose they were censored.}

        Treatment Group & Censored & 1 Dose & 2 Dose & 3 Dose & 4 Dose & 5 Dose & Total\\
        \midrule
        ABC/3TC & 234 & 276 & 110 & 57 & 18 & 7 & 928\\

        \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
    }
    \note{As might be expected as the definition of protocol deviation becomes more strict, requiring more missed doses to be censored, there is a decrease in the number of participants deviating from the protocol. This goes from 276 in the ABC arm and 263 in the TDF arm for the 1 dose protocol down to 7 in each arm under the 5 dose protocol definition.}

     \note{here we can see the risk differences and 95\% confidence intervals based on robust standard errors. As expected as we censored individuals the standard error increased. The changes in the risk difference become more apparent with smaller risk differences when accounting for 1 and 2 dose deviations. This suggest the efficacy of the TDF versus ABC is not quite as large as you might expect if you relied only on a naive analysis.}

 \subsection{Limitations and Future}
    
    \begin{frame}{Limitations and Future Plans}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Completed with public access data.\footnotemark[1]
        \item Reliance on coarse, self-reported medication adherence.
        \item Assume identification conditions met.\footnotemark[2]
        \item Future directions include repeating analysis with g-formula, considering additional protocols, and extending to different diseases. 
    \end{enumerate}
\footnotetext[1]{Approved for more granular data from ACTG, awaiting dataset}
\footnotetext[2]{NB: not guaranteed in per-protocol setting even though it is a trial}
\note{This is a work in progress and There were some limitations.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item this analysis was completed with public data. We have approval from ACTG to obtain more granular data and we will update our results with that
    \item currently this analysis relied on coarse data on adherence and I am currently working to improved estimates of the number of doses that people actually missed.
    \item we assume that we have met all the required identification condigions based on covariates in the IPW models.
\end{enumerate}
Our future directions are to also complete this analysis using the g-formula, and also consider additional granular data once the ACTG provides us with an updated data set}

 \section{Closing Remarks}
\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
\item Per protocol analysis should be treated like an observational analysis.
\item Time varying covariates need to be taken into account.
\item There are many ways protocols can be defined.
\item The way protocol is defined can have meaningful impacts on estimates.
\end{itemize}

\note{here are risk curves for censoring and censoring +protocol deviation. The black line shows only the risk for loss to follow up and there is little difference between the two arms. The red line shows a similar pattern that overlaps closely with the censoring arm. We would expect the more doses required to be missed to approximate the censoring arm. However, if you look at the yellow line the overall risk of being censorid is higher and there is a slightly higher risk in the ABC arm versus the TDF arm in the later time points.}
